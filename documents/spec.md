- Deploy a web application on a platform(AWS or heroku) and post the sourcecode on github that accomplishes the following task:
    - Has a search box that queries the reddit api where a user is able to type in the name of a subreddit and retrieve the newest posts or the most popular posts.
    - Has a results view where I can view the results of the searchbox query and sort the results by date and other additional parameters.
    - Use Angularjs(required) + Flask(preferably) to accomplish this task.
